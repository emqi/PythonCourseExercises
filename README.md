Jupyter notebooks from my univerity's Python course. While the actual code is in english, all comments are currently in polish. That might be subject to change in the future.

## Directories contents:
1. Python basics.
2. Python advanced elements. 
3. Simple web scrapper for scrapping rewievs from Booking.com.
4. Python Pandas.

Requirements:
-------------
* Anaconda for Windows/Mac/Linux (recommended)
* Python 3 + Jupyter Notebook (alternatively, may cause issues)
* All python modules used throughout course should be kept up to date; using outdated moduls will cause mayor issues (e.g. 4th course will generate errors using pandas older than 0.24.2)
